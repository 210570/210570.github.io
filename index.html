				<hr>
				
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws.  </p>
				</div><!-- col-lg-6 -->
				
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>Most species are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. Some possess venom potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction. There are over 2,900 species of snakes ranging as far northward as the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and southward through Australia.[16] Snakes can be found on every continent except Antarctica, in the sea, and as high as 16,000 feet (4,900 m) in the Himalayan Mountains of Asia.</p>

					<p>Of the more than 600 species of venomous snakes found on Earth, only about 200 can do any real damage to humans
					</p>
					<p>Being the worlds most venomous snake does not necessarily mean a specific snake is the deadliest snake. This is because different snakes release varying amounts and concentrations of venom with each bite and some may have fangs that struggle to penetrate. The LD50 data comes from the famous Ernst and Zug list of 1996.</p>
					<p>The chances of dying from a venomous snakebite in the United States is nearly zero, because we have available, high-quality medical care in the U.S. Fewer than one in 37,500 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the U.S. each year (7-8,000 bites per year), and only one in 50 million people will die from snakebite (5-6 fatalities per year).  Did you know that you are nine times more likely to die from being struck by lightning than to die of venomous snakebite?</p>

				<p>King Cobra
The longest venomous snake in the world is the King Cobra. This is a snake that has many people worried because of the way they look and the size of them.
American Copperhead
The American Copperhead is one of the snakes in the world that creates venom. They are often called just the Copperhead for short. In some locations they are referred to as the Moccasin Snake.
Black Mamba
The Black Mamba is considered to be the longest of all snakes found around Africa. It is also considered to be one of the deadliest.
Corn Snake
The Rattlesnake is one of the most common ones you will find out there. They do have a type of venom in them but it usually is not very powerful. There are 30 species though and many subspecies so what they will offer depends on what you come across.</p>

					<h4><b>Pulau Tioman Ground Snake</b></h4>
					
					<p>Pulau Tioman ground snakes are small, vibrantly colored, highly venomous snakes. They have the second-strongest venom of any snake (the black mamba has the most deadly venom), but they are generally considered less dangerous than rattlesnakes because coral snakes have a less effective poison-delivery system.</p>

					<h4><b>King Cobra</b></h4>
					
					<p>King cobras can reach 18 feet (5.5 meters) in length, making them the longest of all venomous snakes. When confronted, they can raise up to one-third of their bodies straight off the ground and still move forward to attack. They will also flare out their iconic hoods and emit a bone-chilling hiss that sounds almost like a growling dog.</p>

					<h4><b>Rattle Snake</b></h4>
				
					<p>Rattlesnakes are known for their relatively heavy bodies and diamond-shaped heads. They are considered to be the newest or most recently evolved snakes in the world. Rattlesnakes have either a rattle or a partial rattle made of interlocking rings, or segments of keratin, the same material our fingernails are made of. When vibrated, the rattle creates a hissing sound that warns off potential predators.</p>

					<p>The fierce snake or inland taipan can reach a total length of 2.5 metres, although 1.8 metres is the more usual length. The upper surface of the snake can vary from dark brown to a light straw colour. Dramatic seasonal colour changes take place, with a darker winter and lighter summer coloration.</p>

						<p>Snakes are found throughout the world except Antarctica, Iceland, Ireland, Greenland and New Zealand. Most snakes are found in tropical regions. Snakes are found in many habitats including in the water, forests, deserts and prairies.</p>
						<p>Snakes cannot survive in places where the ground stays frozen year round so there are no snakes north of the Arctic Circle or in Antarctica.  Some islands, including Ireland and New Zealand, do not have snakes at all. </p>

						<h2>How do they survive?</h2>
						<p>Snakes consume a variety of items including termites, rodents, birds, frogs, small deer and other reptiles. Snakes eat their prey whole and are able to consume prey three times larger than the diameter of their head because their lower jaw can separate from the upper jaw. To keep prey from escaping, snakes have rear-facing teeth that hold their prey in their mouths.</p>
